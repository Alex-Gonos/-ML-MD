# Recurrent Neural Networks for Molecular Dynamics
Python Code and Jupyter Notebooks associated with my Masters Project, "Recurrent Neural Networks for Molecular Dynamics"

#Abstract
Systems in molecular dynamics are governed by ordinary differential equations, expressed through Hamilton's equations. As analytical solutions are not always possible for complex systems, simulations are required to gain intuition on these systems' behaviour. These simulated trajectories are typically generated using numerical methods, including integrators like Euler and Verlet. We explore the application of Neural Network based machine learning for the task of simulation. Applying deep, recurrent and bidirectional neural networks to simple and chaotic systems, we demonstrate the capability of these networks to produce fast, accurate results, that obey physical laws of conservation, in multiple example systems.
